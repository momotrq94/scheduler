# Interview Scheduler

A single page web application built using React that allows users to book appointments, edit appointments and delete appointments. Appointments can be made by inputting Student name and selecting from the available interviewers. Storybook and Jest were used to create components in isolation and to write unit/integration tests. Cypress was used for E2E testing.
